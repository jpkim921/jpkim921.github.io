This javascript project was to update the original Rails App project with some Javascript functionality. Mainly to add some AJAX which is a way for a browser and server to send and receive without reloading the current page.

When starting other projects, I usually had to review a some of the materials to work with some stuff, but for this project, for me it was a major review of Rails and a little bit of Ruby. It wasn't terrible but did take some time and while going over the older material, I kept wondering if this is how it is in the real world.

Again it wasn't terrible since a lot of the stuff rushed back into your head after staring at it for an hour or so but then I started confusing a little bit of the syntax between javascipt and ruby. Currently, in my opinion, I prefer the Javascript was of "structured" writing as opposed to a more "natural" writing of ruby. It'll probably be the other way if I started with JS first.

My original Rails project was a daycare app that kept track of parents, registered children, and classrooms. When I first started, even though we practiced working on the labs and had lots of readings, I still felt a little lost. I knew how to read code but it was a bit different writing from scratch. I must've used console.log() and debugger for almost every line I wrote. But once I actually started to see certain things, it became easier and faster. 

One thing that drove me crazy was when using AJAX to delete a child that belongs to a parent. e.preventDefault() wasn't working and nothing else I did stop the page from loading another page even thought it shouldn't. I read in a blog after googling forever that Rails helpers adds anchor tags which is what caused the problem.

Overall, I feel that this project helped me  to see how different languages really work together and just how important javascript is to the web.

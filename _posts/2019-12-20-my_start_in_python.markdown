#### What is Python?

Python is similar to Ruby in that it's a modern interpreted programming language. Both are easy to learn and are often used as the starting language for those that want to learn. In my experience it was very similar and easy to pick up Python but the hardest was getting used to some of the syntax differences. But it's something you get used to.

##### Example of differing syntax for .join()

```ruby
["the","cat","laughed","at","the","dog"].join(" ")
```

```python
(" ").join(["the","dog","laughed","at","his","tail"])
```

I was always planning on picking up python, but once I watched a couple of videos on django and a intro to data analysis, I really wanted to try it. I have a very limited exposure to it right now but the idea of looking at data and pulling something out of that appeals to me. 

By chance while looking for some more to read I came across a free edx course: [Analyzing Data with Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:IBM+DA0101EN+3T2018/course/). It takes you through a scenario where someone wants to sell their car but uses data analysis of other listed cars to find the best sale price. I can follow along slowly but definitely something I want to finish and learn more about. 

There are so many resources available online but here is where I started:
- [How To Code in Python3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/books/digitalocean-ebook-how-to-code-in-python)

I teaches all the basics and it's true what they say, once you already know a programming language, picking up the next one is much easier.

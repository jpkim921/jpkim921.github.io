Actually, I had my first taste of coding while I still in college. It was C++ and back then I wasn't really into software but more into hardware. I always liked using my hands to take apart and build something and programming isn't something you can hold. That and I remember the professor wasn't that great and most all of the class was lost. Especially when he tried to explain anything...

Anyways..here I am trying to learn to code and it started because I had to learn basic HTML and CSS for work. It looked complicated but it looked like a lot of the same "things" repeating. "Things" like div, b, a href and so on. And when I changed a simple "thing" almost the entire webpage I was on seemed to have exploded. I remember thinking "wth..... " and for the next couple of hours try to figure out (with the help of w3school) how to change the page I was on to what I wanted.

I still suck at but not hopeless. At least it helped jumpstart me down this path.



I totally forgot about the blog and some of them will be late but going forward I'm going to try and make this blog more about answering the quesions I had while learning (still learning) instead of a "How To". It might be hard for me blogging. I don't even use any social media.


So far it's been pleasurable doing the Flatiron online course. There are a lot of good people helping out and a lot of other resources available. The lessons aren't bad at all but I think it could use a little bit of editing or clarifying.

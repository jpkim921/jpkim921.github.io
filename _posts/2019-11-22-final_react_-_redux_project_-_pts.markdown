*   Incorporate separate front and back ends.
*   Flexibility of react
*   Planning & organization
*   More familiar with Flexbox
 
Previously, for the Javascript project, we incorporated Javascript to a Rails apps with all the front and back ends coming from a single source. For this final project, I developed the front and back ends separately and both ends only talked to each other when there was a need for a response from the server api. Aside from the response that ends up in the Redux store, the only bit of code that leads to the server are the urls in the action functions. This particular way of design and the inherent flexibility of react and it’s way of using components, made an impression on me to how adaptive a web app can be.
 
When starting, I was a little nervous because I couldn’t remember Ruby programming but with a little time and review most of it came back pretty quickly. 
 
One of the same mistakes I made in this project was jumping into the code without planning and organizing. I knew roughly what the project was going to look like but because I didn’t actually sit and plan it out, I ended up confusing myself. Maybe a wireframe for each component or how a page was going to render might’ve been the best way. As a result, I ended up changing some of the components a few times which definitely isn’t ideal when developing.
 
As part of the requirements, there needed to be some styling applied to the app. For my project, I used Bootstrap to style certain components into tiles and a few elements with the class "btn" among other things. With bootstrap, elements with that class will automatically  render those elements into a button style design. I used Font Awesome for a few of the icons that was used throughout the app but I changed it to [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/) because I wasn't as satisfied with the design(s).
 
All in all, I felt like I learned a lot through this project and have been eagerly trying to apply it to other little self projects.
 
 
 
 
```html 
<!--  using Bootstrap -->
<input className="btn btn-primary" type="submit" />
```

This Sinatra Project idea is based on activity tracking mainly around running but tried to put alittle bit of cycling into it. A user would sign-up/log-in and then create a new activity by enter name, date, time of activity, etc. 

For me the best part of the project was to learn how to set up so that I could actually start working on the project. I also knew going into the project that the shotgun gem doesn't work with Windows. So after emailing Howard, he said to use the Thin gem if attempting locally, but that you can also do it on the Learn IDE.

If I had to do it again, I would just use the Learn IDE and use the Shotgun gem instead of Thin. From my experience, Thin reloaded VIEWs files, but not the CONTROLLERS, while I remember shotgun reloading both.

Overall the project was a good way of putting to use all the major points of this section.
